## bling-start
This page serves as a tactile launcher for Bling's internal services, loaded by the web browser whenever technicians need to access it. The start-page includes links to client services, Bling services, and useful tools that are accessed frequently during shift work.

Based on the original design concept by [jnsltk](https://github.com/jnsltk/startpages): 'toosimple'.

### Code
Pretty simple code here, easy to follow.
* CSS is (for the most part) included in index.html
* [fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/) used for vector icons
* ~ That's about it!
